## Introduction

Sirato is a data and analytics platform for Ethereum compatible blockchains.

It provides a rich API, and easy to use interface to provide information on the various assets such as tokens, and smart contracts deployed on blockchains.

A free developer edition is available in this repo, we also provide hosted plans for it. They are outlined below.

## Free plan

The advantage of the hosted plan is that all you need to provide is a compatible web3 client endpoint and we will do the rest.
